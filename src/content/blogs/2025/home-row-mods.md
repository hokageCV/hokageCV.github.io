Six months ago, I made one small tweak to my keyboard that changed the way I type every day.

They're called [home row][home_row_mod_blog] [mods][home_row_mod_video]. These are changes to the keyboard's home row, which is the row with `a`, `s`, `d`, `f` keys. The behaviour of these keys is changed. When held, the key acts like a modifier (like `Ctrl`). When tapped, it types the letter as usual.

For example, holding the `f` key works like holding the `Ctrl` key. Just tapping `f` still types the letter `f`.

I [set this up][configuration_video] on my NuPhy Air75 v2, which supports QMK firmware. With the [usevia app][usevia_app], it was easy to assign the modifiers.

This setup feels gentler on the wrists and involves fewer twists and stretches, which lowers the risk of Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI).

At first, I was slow and made lots of typos. But eventually, I got used to it. Now it's super useful, especially the Ctrl and Shift modifiers, since so many shortcuts rely on them.

I can now switch windows faster using the `alt+number` combo in my tiling window manager.

That said, home row mods aren't perfect. I make more typos when typing fast, so now I type a bit slower. And sometimes the keyboard's firmware causes repeated key presses after using mods.
A common mistake is typing `d9` when I mean to type `(`.

Apart from home row mods, I have also remapped the Caps Lock key. Now, tapping it sends `Esc`, and holding it acts as `Ctrl`. This makes it easier to exit insert mode in Vim, without having to reach for the `Esc` key way off in the corner.

I'm still fine-tuning the layout, and might drop one of the modifiers later. But even with its flaws, this setup has been a big win for comfort and speed.
