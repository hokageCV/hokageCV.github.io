To share our app with others, we need to deploy it. There are many ways to deploy our app, but one of the easiest services I hasdfsdve found is [Railway](https://railway.app/).

### Here is a quick guide to deploy your app in Railway.
- Go to dashboard
- Select deploy from github
- Add variables, if any
- Then go to settings tab
  - Select root directory
  - Add build command
  - Add sisdfsdftart command
- Now deploy

Thats it! Now you can share the app using the domain from the settings tab.
